    "# What is Population?\n",
    "In statistics, population is the entire set of items from which you draw data for a statistical study. It can be a group of individuals, a set of items, etc. It makes up the data pool for a study.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is a Sample?\n",
    "A sample is defined as a smaller and more manageable representation of a larger group. A subset of a larger population that contains characteristics of that population. A sample is used in statistical testing when the population size is too large for all members or observations to be included in the test.\n",

    "# Basically, there are two types of sampling. They are:\n",
    "1.Probability sampling\n",
    "2.Non-probability sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "# Probability Sampling\n",
    "In probability sampling, the population units cannot be selected at the discretion of the researcher. This can be dealt with following certain procedures which will ensure that every unit of the population consists of one fixed probability being included in the sample. Such a method is also called random sampling. Some of the techniques used for probability sampling are:\n",

    "In non-probability sampling, the population units can be selected at the discretion of the researcher.
